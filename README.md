## Project Overview

Starting with a pretty generic Spring Boot REST API build-out and slowly expanding into functional CRUD app. Using Copilot to save time but he's a little overconfident sometimes.

### Goals

Create a fully-functional API that I can hit locally with Postman/Insomnia or use a Thymeleaf front end to submit forms with. Determine viability of AI-assisted coding and gain experience with prompts. I'm trying to split the work and manage Copilot more like a tool than a crutch.

### Scope

The idea here is to start off basic and iterate to add features. Once I get the whole thing bootstrapped out, I'll start figuring out how much stack I want to wrap around it.

### Methodology

Build something clean & functional via TDD alongside Copilot.

## Currently in-progress:
- H2 in-memory db spun up and loaded, beginning the overhaul toward real CRUD functionality
- Will fix GET fetching to be real, possibly even adding a findAll()
- Adding POST and PATCH along with business logic to achieve it
- Continuous iterative development, vigilant eye on cleanliness
