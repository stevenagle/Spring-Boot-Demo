## Project Overview

Starting with a pretty generic Spring Boot REST API build-out. Experimenting with Copilot AI to assist in design. Iteratively expanding the project scope and building out functionality.

### Goals

Create a fully-functional API that I can hit locally with Postman/Insomnia. Determine viability of AI-assisted coding and gain experience with prompts. I'm trying to split the work and manage Copilot more like a tool than a crutch.

### Scope

The idea here is to start off basic and iterate to add features. Once I get the whole thing bootstrapped out, I'll start figuring out how much back-end I want to add in. Will add an H2 or MySQL database in soon.

### Methodology

Build something clean & functional via TDD alongside Copilot.
