## Project Overview

This a pretty generic Spring Boot REST API. Right now it's just running local and taking a GET request to fetch a dummy UserProfile by number. Current WIP - slowly building out functionality. It may or may not evolve into something bigger.

### Goals

Create a fully-functional API that I can hit locally with Postman (or maybe I'll try Insomnia). I just wanted to skeleton something to try testing Copilot.

### Scope

The idea here is to start off basic and iterate to add features. Once I get the whole thing bootstrapped out, I'll start figuring out how much back-end I want to add in. For now, the "database" is just be a JSON file. I'll probably continue expanding the "database" as time goes on, possibly implementing Hibernate and an actual database.

### Methodology

Looking to build something clean & functional via TDD alongside Copilot. I'm experimenting with prompts and then proving out the responses.
