## Project Goals

Something to pass the time and keep skills up. Not sure yet what this is going to turn into, but I just started it and will keep committing changes until I'm happy with it. Right now it's just a generic Spring Boot demo API. Not sure how far I'll keep expanding it.

## Scope

The idea here is to start off basic and iterate to add features. Once I get the whole thing bootstrapped out, I'll start figuring out how much back-end I want to add in. For now, the "database" will probably just be a JSON file.

## Methodology

Looking to build something clean & functional via TDD and to experiment with AI. I'm using Copilot to generate some of the boilerplate and refactoring/proofreading as needed. I've never used AI in a project before.
